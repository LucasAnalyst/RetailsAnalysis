## **Project Scenario**

In this project, I'm worked with transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. The main task is to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. 

By conducting exploratory data analysis, I identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data, allowing you to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, you will uncover key trends, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers. Ultimately, this project aims to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance the store's overall performance in the competitive online retail market.

## **Project Objectives**

Describe data to answer key questions to uncover insights

Gain valuable insights that will help improve online retail performance

Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations


In this project, we'll use a data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.
